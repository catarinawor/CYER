	title = {Estimating salmon harvest with coded-wire tags},
	abstract = {We present a simple, comprehensive method to estimate harvest from one or more hatchery-producedor wild cohorts of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) caught simultaneously in one or more stratified commercial or recreational fisheries. The estimator is based on the return of coded-wire tags as modeled with multivariate compound probability distributions for catch sampling programs in which some samples are lost and some tags are not decoded. Knowledge of catches in strata and of tagging rates of cohorts need not be exact as in previously developed methods. Examples concerning historical and hypothetical commercial and recreational fisheries exploiting four cohorts of chinook (Oncorhynchus fshawytscha)and coho salmon (Oncorhynchuskisufch) are provided. Estimated covariancesamong cohorts proved to he negligible to the point of nonexistence for estimated harvests in commercial fisheries, but could be large and positive for estimated harvests in recreational fisheries.Normal approximations of confidence intervals were almost identical to confidence intervals developed with the parametric bootstrap for estimates in commercial fisheries and were less similar when significant harvest came from recreational fisheries.},
